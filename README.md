# scPDA: Denoising Protein Expression in Droplet-Based Single-Cell Data

scPDA is a VAE-based neural network for the task of denoising single-cell surface protein abundance measured by droplet-based technologies such as CITE-seq.

Unlike most currently established methods, scPDA does not require empty droplets. scPDA establishes a probabilistic model for raw count data, and shows a great computational efficiency.
